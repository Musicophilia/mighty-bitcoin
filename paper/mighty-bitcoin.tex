\section{Utility of Attacking}

Assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Future utility is discounted according to a discount rate $\gamma$.
  \item
    The mining power of the Bitcoin network is divided among a fixed set of
    ASICs. ASICs are neither added nor destroyed, just sold between miners.
    Thus, the total mining power of the Bitcoin network remains constant for
    the duration of the model.
  \item
    Every miner assigns the same price (in USD) to a given ASIC. This price is
    determined solely by the ASIC's power, the BTC-USD exchange rate, and the
    discount factor.
    More precisely, each miner values an ASIC depending on how long, at the
    current BTC-USD exchange rate, it would take for the ASIC to pay for
    itself. We intend to guess this valuation function based on real world
    prices for Bitcoin ASICs.
  \item
    If the attacker attacks, then the rest of the Bitcoin network will
    immediately detect the attack and know the number of bitcoin ``stolen''
    (that is, the number of bitcoin that were awarded to the attacker by virtue
    of the attack).
  \item
    The attacker already has a fraction $\ABtcOrig$ of the total BTC
    before the attack.
  \item
    The attacker already has a fraction $\alpha > 0$ of the total mining power
    before the attack.
  \item
    The attacker gets value only in USD, not BTC. Thus, after the attack, the
    attacker will sell the ASICs and BTC to gain value in USD.
\end{enumerate}

Define the following independent variables:

\begin{defs}
  \item[{$\alpha \in (0, \frac{1}{2})$}]
    The mining power of the attacker.
  \item[{$\Attack \in \{0, 1\}$}]
    Whether or not the attacker attacks.
  \item[{$\gamma \in (0, 1]$}]
    The discount rate per time step.
  \item[{$\Time \in [0, \infty)$}]
    The current time step.
  \item[{$\ABtcOrig \in [0, 1]$}]
    The fraction of all bitcoin owned by the attacker before $T = 0$.
%  \item[{$\NumBtc$}]
%    The total number of bitcoin in existence.
\end{defs}

Then the following model parameters and definitions:

\begin{defs}
  \item[{$\ABtcEarned(\Attack, \alpha) \in [0, 1 - B_0]$}]
    The fraction of all bitcoin stolen by the attacker (if Attack = 1) or
    earned by the attacker (if Attack = 0) at $T = 0$.
  \item[{$\ABtcStolen(\Attack, \alpha)
      = \Attack \cdot \ABtcEarned$}]
    The fraction of all bitcoin stolen by the attacker.
  \item[{$\ABtcTotal(\Attack, \alpha)
      = \ABtcOrig + \ABtcEarned$}]
    The total fraction of all bitcoin controlled by the attacker at $T = 0$.
  \item[{$\BtcValue(\ABtcStolen, \Time) \in [0, \infty)$}]
    The total value of all bitcoin in USD after the given number of time steps
    from the attack.
  \item[{$\AsicValue(\BtcValue, \gamma) \in [0, \infty)$}]
    The total value of all Bitcoin mining ASICs in USD. A collection of ASICs
    with mining power $\alpha$ will have value $\alpha \cdot
    \AsicValue$.
    We assume that the value of the Bitcoin ASICs is a function only of the
    BTC-USD exchange rate and the discount factor $\gamma$.
  \item[{$\PayoffBtc(\Attack, \alpha, \TimeCashOut)
      = \ABtcTotal \cdot \BtcValue$}]
    The payout for the attacker of cashing in their bitcoin at time $\TimeCashOut$.
  \item[{$\PayoffAsic(\Attack, \alpha, \gamma, \TimeSellAsics)
      = \alpha \cdot \AsicValue$}]
    The payout for the attacker of selling their ASICs at time $\TimeSellAsics$.
\end{defs}

Suppose the attacker attacks at $\Time = 0$, cashes out from BTC to USD at
$\Time = \TimeCashOut$, and sells the ASICs at time $\Time = \TimeSellAsics$.
We define the utility for the attacker as a function $\Utility(\Attack)$:

\[
  \Utility(\Attack) =
  \max_{\TimeCashOut, \TimeSellAsics}
    \left[
        \PayoffBtc(\Attack, \alpha, \TimeCashOut)
          \cdot \gamma^\TimeCashOut
        + \PayoffAsic(\Attack, \alpha, \gamma, \TimeSellAsics)
          \cdot \gamma^\TimeSellAsics
    \right]
\]

We define the utility of attacking over mining as:

\[
  \AttackUtility = \Utility(1) - \Utility(0)
\]

We assume that the attacker will attack if and only if $\AttackUtility$ is
strictly positive.
