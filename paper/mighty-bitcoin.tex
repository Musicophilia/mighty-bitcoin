\section{Utility of Attacking}

Assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		Future utility is discounted according to a discount rate $\gamma$.
	\item
		The mining power of the Bitcoin network is divided among a fixed number
		$\NumAsics$ of equally powerful ASICs. That is, each ASIC controls a fixed
		portion $1/\NumAsics$ of the total Bitcoin mining power.
	\item
		Every miner assigns the same price (in USD) to an ASIC. This price is
		determined solely by the BTC-USD exchange rate and the discount factor.
		More precisely, each miner values an ASIC depending on how long, at the
		current BTC-USD exchange rate, it would take for the ASIC to pay for
		itself. We intend to guess this valuation function based on real world
		prices for Bitcoin ASICs.
	\item
		If the attacker attacks, then the rest of the Bitcoin network will
		immediately detect the attack and know the number of bitcoin ``stolen''
		(that is, the number of bitcoin that were awarded to the attacker by virtue
		of the attack).
	\item
		The attacker already has $\ABtcOrig$ fraction of the total BTC
		before the attack.
	\item
		The attacker already has a fraction $\alpha$ of the total mining power
		before the attack, and so the attacker has already purchased $\alpha \cdot
		\NumAsics$ ASICs.
	\item
		The attacker gets value only in USD, not BTC. Thus, after the attack, the
		attacker will sell the ASICs and BTC to gain value in USD.
\end{enumerate}

Define the following independent variables:

\begin{enumerate}[labelindent=0pt,labelwidth=2in,itemindent=0em,align=parleft,leftmargin=!]
	\item[{$\alpha \in (0, \frac{1}{2})$}]
		The mining power of the attacker.
	\item[{$\Attack \in \{0, 1\}$}]
		Whether or not the attacker attacks.
	\item[{$\gamma \in (0, 1]$}]
		The discount rate per time step.
	\item[{$\Time \in [0, \infty)$}]
		The current time step.
	\item[{$\ABtcOrig \in [0, 1]$}]
		The fraction of all bitcoin owned by the attacker before $T = 0$.
	\item[$\NumAsics$]
		The total number of bitcoin mining machines.
\end{enumerate}

Then the following parameters:

\begin{enumerate}[labelindent=0pt,labelwidth=2in,itemindent=0em,align=parleft,leftmargin=!]
	\item[{$\ABtcEarned(\Attack, \alpha) \in [0, 1 - B_0]$}]
		The fraction of all bitcoin stolen by the attacker (if Attack = 1) or
		earned by the attacker (if Attack = 0) after TimeStep 0.
	\item[{$\ABtcStolen(\Attack, \alpha) = \Attack \cdot \ABtcEarned(\Attack, \alpha)$}]
		The fraction of all Bitcoin stolen by the attacker.
	\item[{$\ABtcTotal(\Attack, \alpha) = \ABtcOrig + \ABtcEarned(\Attack, \alpha)$}]
		The total fraction of all bitcoin controlled by the attacker after TimeStep
		0.
	\item[{$\ExchgRate(\ABtcStolen(\Attack, \alpha), \Time) \in [0, \infty]$}]
		The value of a bitcoin in USD after the given number of time steps from the
		attack.
	\item[{$\AsicValue(\ExchgRate(\ldots), \gamma)$}]
		TODO
\end{enumerate}

Suppose the attacker attacks at $\Time = 0$, cashes out from BTC to USD at
$\Time = \TimeCashOut$, and sells the ASICs at time $\Time = \TimeSellAsics$.
We define the utility for the attacker as a function $\Utility(\Attack)$:

\[
	\Utility(\Attack) =
	\max_{\TimeCashOut, \TimeSellAsics}
		\left[
			(\ABtcTotal(\Attack, \alpha) \cdot \ExchgRate(\ABtcStolen, \TimeCashOut))
				\cdot \gamma^\TimeCashOut
			+
			(\alpha \cdot \NumAsics \cdot \AsicValue(\ExchgRate(\ABtcStolen, \TimeSellAsics), \gamma))
				\cdot \gamma^\TimeSellAsics
		\right]
\]

We define the utility of attacking over mining as:

\[
	\AttackUtility = \Utility(1) - \Utility(0)
\]

We assume that the attacker will attack if and only if $\AttackUtility$ is
strictly positive.
